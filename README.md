### greetings, meri here!
- she/her
- Trying to (re)learn HTML/CSS further, apart from wiki editing work (mainly on the [SideM](https://sidem.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page) and [Wind Boys!](http://windboys.fandom.com/) wikis)
- Currently in the (slow) process of creating my own fan translation/blog and art portfolio sites! And also to serve as a personal archive.
- Occasionally tinkers around in a few other projects whenever I have time or I feel like it. Usually the latter.
