### greetings, meri here!
- 🔭 Trying to (re)learn HTML/CSS, apart from wiki editing work (mainly on the [SideM](https://sidem.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page) and [Wind Boys!](http://windboys.fandom.com/) wikis)
- 📝 Currently in the (slow) process of creating my own fan JP/EN translation blog (to serve as a personal archive for fan projects) and art portfolio sites!
- 🖥️ Occasionally tinkers around in a few other projects whenever I ~~have time~~ feel like it.
- Stream ["Learning Message"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5ICy98VAWQfVgBialQdD6s) okay thanks
